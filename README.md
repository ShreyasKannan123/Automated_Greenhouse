## Introduction

Modern agriculture's reliance on controlled environments like greenhouses for crop cultivation led to the development of this automated greenhouse system. Designed to maintain optimal conditions for tomato plants, it focuses on monitoring and controlling environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity.

## Components Required

- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- LDR module
- Capacitative Soil Moisture Sensor (SEN0193)
- Servo Motors (2)
- LCD Display
- DC Fan
- Arduino Microcontroller
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Milestone 1: Sensing and Acquisition

This phase involves requirements analysis for sensors and sensors' elements, calibration methods, and functional/non-functional requirements of sensors. The chosen sensors like DHT11, LDR, and capacitive soil moisture sensors were analyzed for precision, reliability, and real-time data acquisition.

## Milestone 2: Actuation and Monitoring

Addressing actuation, monitoring, and control, this stage outlines servo motor usage for controlling blinds and irrigation, DC fan operation for humidity and temperature control, and calibration methodologies for various sensors. The report discusses how each actuator effectively impacts environmental control.

## Milestone 3: System Implementation

The final stage details the greenhouse's physical setup, including servo-controlled blinds, drip irrigation, and placement of sensors. It covers the validation and root cause analysis of system failures, suggesting redesigns for better functionality.

## Observations and Graphs

Collected data and plotted graphs for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity are presented here. It showcases the system's real-time performance and adherence to optimal plant growth conditions.

## Future Scope

The report discusses potential improvements like AI optimization for tailored environmental conditions, water leakage mitigation, and closed systems for CO2 measurements. It presents avenues for enhancing the greenhouse's efficiency and productivity.

## Conclusion

The Automated Greenhouse signifies a significant advancement in agriculture by combining technology, precise control systems, and environmental monitoring. It emphasizes sustainable and intelligent plant cultivation while offering adaptability and efficiency for various plant species.
